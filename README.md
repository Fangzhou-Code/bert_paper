# bert_paper
This is code for my first paper about federated learning and blockchain.
In paper,i designed a new architecture for federated learning and blockchain.

# architecture flow.
1. BS: GPUandCPU_allocation.py--->model--->set_params
2. 6GBS: GPUandCPU_allocation.py--->get_params--->model

# notice
you may think wow!
However, my code so sucks.hahaha

i'm sorry wasting your time to view in this repo.

# bert_paper
This is code for my first paper about federated learning and blockchain.

In paper,i designed a new architecture for federated learning and blockchain.


# architecture flow.
1. BS: GPUandCPU_allocation.py--->model--->set_params

2. 6GBS: GPUandCPU_allocation.py--->get_params--->model



# run
you just need to run passKeyInfoToSolidty.py.
It will automatically run BS_Inference_of_Chinese_Sentence_Relationships

-->MBS_Inference_of_Chinese_Sentence_Relationships

-->MerkleTree_Based_Data_Compression: compress parms

-->pass compressed parms to solidty




# notice
you may think fantastic!
However, my code so sucks.

i'm sorry wasting your time to view in this repo.
